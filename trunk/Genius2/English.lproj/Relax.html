<h1>Learning How To Learn</h1>

<p>The human brain produces four types of brain waves or electrical rhythms: alpha, beta, theta, and delta. Theta and delta are generally associated with sleep.</p>

<p>Beta (faster) is the dominant rhythm in normal adults who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open. It occurs during everyday modern life when we are dealing with the outside world, involved in thinking or calculating, or otherwise in stressful situations.</p>

<p>Alpha (slower) is the major rhythm seen in relaxed adults. It is the state associated with daydreaming and meditation; alpha is characterized by sensation instead of thinking. One is free of tensions and anxieties, unconcerned with the body, and alert to new stimuli. <b>Research has found alpha to be the mental state that is most conducive to learning.</b></p>


<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>To put yourself in the alpha state, move away from the computer. Close your eyes and listen to some relaxing music. Or try the following technique:</p>

<p><blockquote>
<p>Spread your arms as wide as you can. Wiggle your fingers and move your arms until you can see your fingers wiggling in your peripheral vision. <b>Hold your range of vision like that.</b> You can drop your arms, but keep your head up. Relax.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t look at anything specific, and don&#8217;t think about anything specific. If you do, let it pass, then return to &#8220;wide angle vision.&#8221; Just try to capture the entire scene; you&#8217;ll start to recognize objects without looking at them. Keep your mind clear. Breathe. Feel yourself slow down. Imagine yourself as a camera...</p>
</blockquote></p>

<p>After a few minutes, you should feel calm and detached from the world. Then you&#8217;ll be ready to begin.</p>
