This code branch is dead. It seems to be an attempt to upgrade the UI and use Core data.  Unfortunately
it is:
 1. Only halfway finished.
 2. Contains all the bugs of the original version.
 3. Contains several new bugs.
 4. Doesn't work.
 5. Isn't really compatible with the old version.
 6. Doesn't include an unit tests that might have provided a clue as to what this code is meant to do.
 7. Extends a questionable gui in ever more questionable directions.

There are probably other reasons to not carry forward it's development, but I'm not inclined to read the 
source code anymore.
